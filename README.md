# CS373-Project

1.	Team number (as registered in Brightspace).

2.	Studentsâ€™ name and Purdue e-mail (as registered in Brightspace). The project is to be done in groups of 3 students.

3.	[Up to 3 lines] Definition of the problem, possibly relevant to your interests.

4.  [Up to 5 lines] Which dataset will be used? The dataset should be already publicly available. 
    For possible datasets, see the course website https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/21spring-cs37300.html
    Describe how many samples/features has the dataset. Give me some idea of how you plan to transform the dataset into a table of data that a machine learning algorithm can use.
    If the dataset is too large, then choose fewer samples (for instance 1000 or smaller). If the dataset has too many features, then arbitrarily choose few of those features (for     instance 100 or smaller). Remember that cross validation takes time, and the larger the dataset, the more time this will take.

5.  URL where the above dataset is available.

6.  [Up to 5 lines] Which TWO machine learning algorithms are going to be used? (e.g., SVM, classification trees, etc.) You are allowed to either implement this from scratch or use third-party code, e.g., scikit-learn.

7.  [Up to 5 lines] Which cross-validation technique(s) is(are) going to be used? (e.g., training/validation/testing, k-fold cross-validation, bootstrapping). You MUST implement this from scratch.

8.  [Up to 10 lines] Which hyperparameter(s) is(are) going to be tuned. You MUST implement this from scratch.

9.  [Up to 10 lines] Which TWO experimental results will you show? (e.g., plots of number of samples versus accuracy using different subsets of the dataset, hyperparameter versus accuracy, ROC curves, etc.) You MUST implement this from scratch. Plots of the data itself DO NOT count as experimental results.

10. Which programming language are you going to use? (Only MATLAB, C++, Java and Python are allowed. Jupyter notebooks are NOT allowed.)
